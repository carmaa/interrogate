Interrogate
===========

Interrogate is a proof-of-concept tool for identification of cryptographic keys
in binary material (regardless of target operating system), first and foremost
for memory dump analysis and forensic usage. Able to identify AES, Serpent, 
Twofish and DER-encoded RSA keys as of version 0.0.4. 

The tool was written as a part of my Masterâ€™s Thesis at NTNU.

Disclaimer
----------
Do no evil with this tool. Also, I am a pentester, not a developer. So if you
see weird code that bugs your purity senses, drop me a note on howI can improve 
it. Or even better, fork my code, change it and issue a pull request.
